This is a Website for Recipe Management. This includes Homepage, Add page and View page. 
The Home page basically is a simple introduction page along with the buttons that redirect to Add and View pages.
The Add page is form where we add all descriptions about a recipe and then add them . I have used local storage to save the recipes .
The View Page basically extracts data from the local storage and displays it . There is a Search bar, Also SOrting and filtering options.
The recipes can be deleted and favourited also .
